This note describes the current state of a project whose aim is to match
roots from the {sd mADavIyA DAtuvftti} (mdp) with records from the Monier-Williams (mw)
Sanskrit-English dictionary.
The source of mdp information is the mdp/MadhaviyaDhP2_entries.xml file.  The source of
mw information is monier.xml from the Cologne Sanskrit-Lexicon.
An additional source of information, used indirectly but substantively, is the
Westergaard Dhatupatha (wdp). This has been used in two ways. First, a listing of the
Westergaard sutras was developed; by reading the wdp sutras in conjunction with the
Madhaviya sutras, a correspondence was made between the two; this may be seen
in the WestergaardDhP1.xml file.  Second, a list of references by mw to the 
Westergaard Dhatupatha was developed (such as mwtab1/Dha1tupd.txt). While there are
imperfections in the mdp-wdp and mw-wdp correspondences, they nonetheless prove useful 
as a bridge between mdp and mw.

The balance of this note describes the information available in two files in 
subdirectory match5/key9:  
- matchman2.txt is a tab-delimited file showing the matches between mdp records
(identified by an 'msid') and mw records (identified by an 'L' record number).
- matchman2.html,  an html file displaying some of the supporting data upon which
  the matching information in matchman2.txt is based.

Programming note:
 - the batch file 'redo.bat' in match5 subdirectory updates both these files based upon
   numerous intermediates.

The fields in matchman2.txt: Consider some samples:
NOMDP	NOMDP	aMS	9	V=10	CLASS=N	DEF=N	MATCH=N	GROUP=NOMDP	wdp variant dp
aMsa	10.304-01	aMs	87	V=10	CLASS=Y	DEF=N	MATCH=N	GROUP=N1	
ast	10.084-01	NOMW	NOMW	V=0	CLASS=N	DEF=N	MATCH=N	GROUP=NOMW1	mdp not in mw
Ap	10.230-01	Ap	24743	V=5,C	CLASS=P	DEF=Y	MATCH=P	GROUP=YG	MW shows Caus.


 key1 = the mdp normalized root  (= NOMDP if not present)
 msid = the mdp identifier       (= NOMDP if not present)
       the file mdp/mdp.xml  has the list of 2276 entries.
       From the file 'mdp/norm-mw.txt' there are 1531 different values of key1
 key2 = the mw 'key1' field      (= NOMW if not present)
 L    = the mw record id         (= NOMW if not present)
  The file mwverb/mwroots.txt has 1971 lines, one for each L.
  From mdp/norm-mw.txt, there are 1823 different values of key2.
 v    = the classes in mw record (in a few cases, these are inferred)
 vstat = status of match between the class implicit in msid and the class(es) in 'v'. 
         value is CLASS=N (msid class not in v), 
                        P (msid class in v, which has additional values), 
                        Y (msid class = v)
         In some cases, such as 'Ap', MW has a causal , and 'C' is shown as one of the mw classes.
         This is treated as matching msid class 10.
 dstat = status of match between the definitions of the mdp senses and the mw root definitions.
         Using mdp 'senses' attributes and MW dictionary, a set of English definitions was developed
         for each mdp sense.  These are in the file mdp/sense/sensemw1.txt (719 senses)
         Also, a set of simplified definitions of the MW roots was developed; these
          are in the file mwverb/sense/rootsense1.txt.
         Then, a set of correspondences between these two sets of definitions was developed; these are
          in the file mwtab1/sense/sensemap1.txt.
         It is  on the basis of these files that a given msid-L combination is marked as having
         a matching definition (DEF=Y) or not (DEF=N).
  stat = combination of vstat and dstat. If either vstat or dstat is 'N', so is the value of stat;
         otherwise, stat = vstat (P or Y).
  gstat = a group matching status.
         The records of matchman are formed into groups based upon 'key1' (the mdp normalized root).
         Then, a matching status code is developed for all the records in a given group of matchman2,
         and coded as 'GROUP=code'. Here are all the codes, and their meaning:
   754   Y1 : Only one member of the group, and mdp and mw match.
   287   YG : More than one member of the group, and the classes match in aggregate, and the definitions
              match individually.  
    26   NNom: The mdp record (usu. with cl. 10) matched a record mw described as 'Nom.' (A root derived
               from a nominal; the mw class is usually inferred).
   307   NOMDP:  The MW key2 could not be matched with an mdp key.
    36   NOMW1:  There was only 1 record with the mdp key, and no mw record matched
     6   NOMW2:  There was more than 1 record with the mdp key, and no mw record matched
   194   NG1: One or more records in group, all the definitions match, all the msid classes are among the
              mw classes, but mw has some extra classes.
    45   N1 : Just one record in group, and either the definitions don't match, or else the mdp
              class is not among the mw classes.
     6   NG0: More than one record in group, and each of them is inconsistent with respect to definition or
              class.
   145   NPG: More than one record in group, at least one of them is inconsistent with respect to definition or
              class, and at least one of them is consistent.

  1804 groups

There are various ways one might further summarize the situation of matching.
The 1041 groups in Y1 and YG are most likely matched correctly.
The 349 groups in NOMDP, NOMW1, and NOMW2 are thus far unmatchable.
  In the case of the larger NOMDP group, perhaps there are additional pAWAntaras in mdp. However,
  since Westerguaard has considered mdp, most cases may be due to other authors, such as Vopadeva,
  and will not be ultimately found in mdp.
The 26 groups in NNom could perhaps be deemed to match by ignoring the fact that MW classes them as
   denominatives.
The 51 groups in N1 and NG0 seem questionably matched, though perhaps some definitions thus far
   deemed inconsistent could be deemed consistent (for instance, with 'sev' the mdp definition 'secana'
   perhaps has been misread as 'sevana'). As another instance, consider 'Parv'. Here there is only
   one root in mw and in mdp spelled 'Parv', and each source appears as class 1; however, the 
   definitions are completely different;  on the one hand, surely each source is talking about the
   same root; on the other hand, if so, why are the definitions not comparable?
The 194 groups in NG1 probably match, but for some reason mw found instances of classes which were not
   identified by mdp.
The 145 groups in NPG are partially matched, and perhaps some inconsistencies can be overlooked or explained
   similarly to differences in N1,NG0 and NG1.

Notes regarding matchman2.html
- The records are listed in mdp order.
- The group code ('Y1, YG, etc.) is printed, and so may be searched for in the browser.
  The background color of records is also adjusted to assist the eye.  Groups Y1 and YG have
  white background, groups NOMW1, NOMW2 and NOMDP have a grey background.
  NNOM has a green background. The rest have a tan or yellow background.
- Within in each record, matching definitions appear in green text, non-matching in red text.
  Note that in the case of matching definitions, there may be additional nom-matching 
  definitions for either the mw entry or the mdp entry; these non-matching cases are omitted from
  the display.
- If the mw headword and the mdp normalized root agree in spelling, then only the common value is
  shown in the first column; when there is a difference, both are shown, with the mdp root 
  appearing in parentheses and in red text.
- The word 'artificial' or 'genuine' appears near the root name and refers to whether the
  mw headword is written in large or small devanagari.
- In the 'DP' column, a symbol ('check' or 'warning') indicates the value of 'stat' (i.e., whether
   the individual record shown on a line is a match.  The msid is shown in green (along with the
   mw class in the first column) provided the msid class is among the mw class(es); otherwise, 
   both msid and mw class are shown in red.
-  The wsid (Westergaard identifier) corresponding to msid is show in the DP column; it is shown
   in green if present as a reference in the mw record, and in red otherwise.  There are a few cases
   (for instance, 'kaW') where the wsid is shown as 'NA', despite the fact that in the mw record
   there is a reference (9.48 for 'kaW').
-  There are a few miscellaneous comments in the last column


Notes some peculiarities in matchman2.txt.

- There are more than 300 records in matchman2 in which a correspondence is made between
  an mdp record and an mw record for which the mdp normalized root is spelled differently than the
  mw headword. (in the html, these may be found by searching for ')KD'.
  Discounting duplicates, there are 293 ($key1,$key2) pairs with $key1 not equal to $key2.
  These instances may be subdivided: (see key9/matchman2-keydiff.txt)
  - 70: Class 10 roots which in mdp have a root ending in 'a', and where mw headword omits the final 'a'.
  - 27: cases where the mw entry is a denominative.
  - 178: Cases where the mw headword inserts a nasal before a final consonant (or consonant cluster).
    The corresponding mdp entries have the marker 'i'.
    There may be a few mdp entries with marker 'i' for which mw does not insert a nasal.
  - 14: Cases where the mdp headword ends in 'cC' but the mw headword ends in 'C' (without the 'c').
      In three of these, mw inserts a nasal, and the mdp entry has marker 'i'.
  - 4: Other cases. These appear doubtful.

- indirect mw information.
  - 191 mw records were reclassified as roots. Roots are tagged in the Cologne monier.xml by the
    empty markup '<vlex type="root"></vlex>'. In many of these cases, the mw record will contain only
    some kind of pointer to another record previously marked as a root. In particular, there may be
    no class or definition present in such a record.  In these cases, the class and definition 
    information were taken from the record pointed to by the referential mw record. 
    (see mwverb/verb/add.txt)
  - Incidentally, the file drop.txt contains 51 records which were previously classified as roots,
    but which upon closer examination were thought to be inappropriately so classified.  Many of
    these are causal forms, desiderative stems, etc.
  - In some cases, the wdp references in an mw record must be inferred by the context of the record;
    for instance, one may see 'ix,15' and can infer that this means wdp 9.15 because of a previous
    citation, usually within the record, but occasionally within the previous record.
- sense comparisons.
  The idea trying to match mw definitions with the mdp senses came into my mind as a result of
  a comment by Chandrashekar.  Since the mw definitions are in English and the mdp senses are in
  Sanskrit, it became necessary to develop some means to determine whether ceratin English phrases
  and Sanskrit phrases should be considered as semantically the same or different. My approach was
  to convert the Sanskrit senses into English, by using the MW dictionary, and then to compare these
  English senses with the given English senses present in the mw records for corresponding roots.
  In most cases, some common word appearing in both sources served as the basis for equality.
  In some cases, an English synonym for some word in one source would, by appearing in a putative
  correspondence, provide the basis for a match.
  In some cases, I did not hesitate to use considerable imagination in looking for correspondence 
  between records that otherwise matched in terms of root spelling and class.
  Since the correspondence, while explicit in the data structures, was subjectively developed,
  it is likely that other readers would develop the correspondences differently.  In particular,
  someone more familiar with Sanskrit might disavow certain sense equalities, and avow certain
  sense inequalities.
