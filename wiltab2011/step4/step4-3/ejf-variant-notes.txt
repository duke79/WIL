EJF made corrections to either MW or Wilson databases, and changed
the variant-edit markup accordingly, putting auth="EJF".

1. wil=aNkola.  mw = aNkowa   :  mw has several variants, including
  aNkola.  Prob. should add these to mw headwords  (DONE)

2. wil=awwAlaka, mw = awwAla :  add mw headword awwAlaka
   (DONE)

4. wil= AcArabarjjita.   From the scan, it is hard to distinguish whether
   the scan says 'bar' or 'var'.  In the etymology, as digitized, 'barjjita'
   is seen with meaning 'abandoned'; again, the scan could read 'varjjita',
   and this is supported by the fact that 'varjjita' is a headword with
   meaning 'abandoned', while 'barjjita' is not a headword.
  
   Thus, it is possible that the wilson headword is incorrectly digitized,
   and should be digitized as AcAravarjjita.
   (DONE)

   NOTE: SM pointed out that the scans are in fact quite likely 'barjjita'.
   The headword was changed back to AcArabarjjita in wiltab1, and
   the record of edit1 was replaced with the original record of edit.xml wa
8. wil=icCAbat.  This appears to be a typo for 'icCAvat'.  Correct wiltab1.
   (DONE)

7. wil=AlagarddaM.   Not (currently) a wilson headword.  
   Apparently, a correction to digitized Wilson was made (to Alagardda).

   Alagardda  is a wilson headword.  Which corresponds in meaning (Cobra)
   to mw 'Alagarda'.
   NOTE:  in the xml file, there appears a correction for wilson to
   'Alagardda'.  The html processing code is not detecting this!
   NOTE1: EJF removed the corrected error, 
   thus changing the edit.xml file from
   <wil err="scan" corr="Alagardda">AlagarddaM</wil>
 to 
   <wil>Alagardda</wil>

   NOTE: An alternate coding would have been to place 'corrected="y"' as
   an attribute of 'rule'.

------------------------------------
3. wil=Akzoqa , mw=Akzowa : mw states = 'akzowa'.
    under 'akzowa', mw mentions several alternate spellings,
   which prob. should add to mw headwords.
   akzoqa 
   akzoqaka
        Akzowa  (already a headword)
   Akzoqaka
   AKowa (already a headword)
   NOTE:  the wilson variant is not among the new mw headwords.
   So, no change in SM markup made by EJF.
-----------------------------------
These are questions for Peter:

6. wil=Ayuskara , note says 'incorrect form in Wil'.  Should this be
   corrected (to Ayuzkara) in digitized edition?
9. wil=IrzyamAna.  Note says 'incorrect form in wilson'.  Should we correct?
NOTE: SM marked both of these with 'cclass="W"'; Records with such markings
can be gathered at some point for Peter's evaluation.  These two records
need not be mentioned at this time.

------------------------------------
EJF not clear on this association made by SM.  <<====
10. wil=parikzipaka , mw=parikzepaka .  What is the basis for association?
  This is identified as a false form in WIlson by Boehtlingk. 
  Further, SM discovered that a Paninian rule shows that the 'aka' suffix
  to 'parikzip' results in the guRa of 'i' to 'e'.
  Note:  it is possible that corrections to such forms should be 
  made in the digitized edition; this is analogous to 6/9 above.
  The comment could be used as a filter in such cases.

------------------------------------
Observation
5. wil = AjYAnuvarttin  would be mw compound: AjYA and anuvarttin

(this is a random observation)
