<h1>Lexical Consultation Wilson--Moinier Williams</h1>
<h3>Peter M. Scharf</h3>
<h3>15 August 2011</h3>
<p>Under our grant from the NEH/DFG in collaboration with the University of Cologne to synthesize and revise Sanskrit lexical sources, we are integrating various lexical sources into a single digital interface.  This involves first and foremost correlating the headwords in the various lexical sources.  To achieve this we consider the conventions of each source and write rules to map from a canonical headword list to the list of headwords in each lexical source.  We then search for every headword in each lexical source in the canonical list and vice versa.  If a form is not found, we figure out why and attempt to map it to the closest corresponding form.  The reasons a headword in a specific lexical source is not found in our canonical list or vice versa are various: typing errors, printing errors, variants, alternate sandhi, lack of forms with certain derivational affixes or inflectional terminations.</p>
<p>Our first attempt to correlate headwords is between Wilson's Sanskrit-English Dictionary and Monier Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary.  Since Monier Williams' Dictionary (MW) is much more comprehensive, we first look up all the words in Wilson in MW.  About 5,000 words were not found.  About a thousand of these seemed to vary because of predictable differences and we attempted to classify those differences according to regular criteria and map the Wilson headword to the suspected match in MW.  We then asked a post-doc to check each pair for accuracy.  I then checked the post-doc's work.  The following table contains the list of categories we used to classify the Wilson headword.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>code</th><th>class</th><th>description</th>
<tr><td>G</td><td>Grammar</td><td>Monier Williams has excluded the form because he considered it a regular grammatical derivate, such as a participle, an abstract noun formed by the addition of <i>-tā</i>, or <i>-tva</i>, etc., or it is a compound of elements that are found in MW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>V</td><td>Variant</td><td>Variant spelling or sandhi, for example, Wilson has <i>b</i> instead of MW's <i>v</i>, or <i>ṃ</i> instead of <i>ṅ</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>ṇ</i>, <i>n</i> or <i>m</i>, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Error</td><td>Error in Wilson, i.e. There is a typo in the digital file made from Wilson's dictionary or a printing error in Wilson's dictionary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Wrong</td><td>Wrong form in Wilson, but it was deliberate.  This code tells us to depracate the form so that we do not produce all inflected varieties of it for our full form lexicon, yet we do not correct it nor remove it from Wilson's dictionary.  E.g. Wilson <i>patra</i> which we map to <i>pattra</i> in MW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>New</td><td>Word not in MW (and not "GVEWQ").  It's just a different word in Wilson but not in MW, e.g. <i>adhyaya</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Q</td><td>Question</td><td>Unsure whether the mapping is correct or not</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A procedural question arises as to how we should handle factual errors, i.e. those classed as W in the above list.  It is my opinion that we should not correct them because it may be of historical interest to researchers that certain errors were made by certain lexicographers at certain times and places.  Instead we should keep the error as is, flag it as a deprecated form, and map it to the correct form in our canonical list and other lexical sources.  We should not use such forms for the purpose of generating a list of correct Sanskrit inflected forms (our full-form lexicon), and we should indicate that the form is deprecated by us in some way in the digital display.  Nevertheless, I felt it adviseable to consult with you about this procedure and to present you with a few challenging examples.  Please let me know whether you approve of the way I am handling these or whether you have suggestions for improvement or have an entirely different opinion of how to handle them.</p>
<p>Clicking the Wilson or MW word in the table below looks up the word in the on-line digital dictionary.  Clicking the page number in the digital entry of each dictionary brings up a digital image of the page on which the entry appears.  You can search for a different word in the digital dictionary by editing the data-entry field.  The encoding has been set by default to SLP1, but you can change that by selecting KH or ITrans from the input pull-down menu.  Likewise, the output default has been set to display Sanskrit text in Unicode Devanagari, but you can change this to Unicode Roman or one of the input encodings by selecting it from the output pull down menu.</p>

"f. (<i>-ṇḍī</i>)" is a factual error or a Prakritization but it makes no sense to have the headword one thing and the lexid another.  So do we show what Wilson actually has printed (<i>ciraṇḍhī</i>) or do we revise it to reflect what his etymology suggests (<i>ciraṇṭī</i>)?  Wilson also has an entry for <a target="WIL" href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/WILScan/disp3/index.php?filter=SktDevaUnicode&translit=SLP1&key=ciriRWI"><i>ciriṇṭhī</i></a>.  MW has <i>ciraṇṭī</i> as headword and <i>ciraṇṭhī</i> and <i>ciraṇḍhī</i> as subentries.  He also has <a target="MW" href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?filter=SktDevaUnicode&translit=SLP1&key=ciriRwI"><i>ciriṇṭī</i></a>)</td></tr>

The <i>Kāśikā</i> on <i>A.</i> 1.4.57 includes <i>tu</i> in the list <i>cādi</i>, and <i>A.</i> 1.4.96 terms <i>api</i> <i>karmapravacanīya</i>.</td></tr>

We adopt the policy of removing the final <i>a</i> in the digital presentation of Wilson's Dictionary.  There is an additional factual error in Wilson, however.  I believe the <i>ñ</i> in <i>uñjh</i> and <i>uñjha</i> is a misreading of <i>j</i>, yet the headwords are alphabetized under <i>uñj...</i>, so it not a typo but is deliberate.  No root <i>uñjh</i> occurs in the <i>Mādhavīyadhātuvṛtti</i>.</td></tr>
