Peter's notes made on 14-15 August 2011 to Jim's readme.txt 13 Aug. 2011.

1. removed 2 lines ...

PMS: This one is also a correction to be made to MW
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="GRAMMAR">tva</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="Q">MW 1201c has both sADutA and sADutva</c> <wil>sADutva</wil> <mw>sADu</mw>
ejf1:  20110816  correction made to MW.

1a.	This type of difference is treated differently elsewhere
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="SS" cclass="_">y</c> <wil>gurupatra</wil> <mw>gurupattra</mw>

PMS: This should also be treated like the other x-patra, i.e.
ejf1:  moved following gurupatra to wilson-map.txt  (along with the rest of the 'tt->t' instances)
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>gurupatra</wil> <mw>gurupattra</mw>


2d.	PMS: sammAda not found in digital mw
ejf1:  correction now made to mw


3a.	PMS: cclass="G" does reclassify the class as to GRAMMAR.  All records that have class="ERROR" but cclass="x" where x is anything other than _ (underscore) [or "E"], are not errors in Wilson.  They are mapping issues and should all be put in "rest"
ejf1:  moved record to wilson-map.txt

3b.	PMS: the cclass here is anomalously "MW" but in any case it is not "_" so belongs in "rest" not in the error file.
ejf1:  This record does NOT need to be in the rest file. Since the correction to MW, the word is in both
wilson and mw.

4b.	reclassification of 'pattra' types.  PMS: Our lapse.  Changed cclass to "W".  Should change 'tt' back to 't' and map.
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="SS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>aBIrupatrI</wil> <mw>aBIrupattrI</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="SS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>elApatra</wil> <mw>elApattra</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="SS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>gurupatra</wil> <mw>gurupattra</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>SyAmapatra</wil> <mw>SyAmapattra</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>sapatrAkaraRa</wil> <mw>sapattrAkaraRa</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>sapatrAkfti</wil> <mw>sapattrAkfti</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">t/tt</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">y</c> <wil>sarapatrikA</wil> <mw>sarapattrikA</mw>
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">Ca/Cu</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="W">SS: diff words,diff meanings. PMS: remapped t/tt</c> <wil>tripatra</wil> <mw>tripattra</mw>
ejf1: did the following:
  a.  Change wilson back to 'gurupatra', etc.
  b.  Move these 'W' records to wilson-map.txt

4.
Corrected. remap?
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">m/s</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="E">SS: entry should have been mahIyas. PMS: right, but algorithm mad two substitutions instead of just one. Added attributes.</c> <wil err="typo" corr="mahIyas">mahIyam</wil> <mw>sahIyas</mw>
PMS: corrected form is identical to mw form, i.e. map to: <mw>mahIyas</mw>
ejf1:  No remapping required.  mahIyas is in both mw and wilson.  the presence of 'sahIyas' in the rule
above is an error in the rule.

Corrected. remap?
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">Ca/Ce</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="E">MW has correct entry too [L=250964] but not found upon ordinary search; only found with prefix search in advanced search. ejf changed mw field to sUkzmamakzika</c> <wil err="typo" corr="sUkzmamakzikA">sUkzmakzikA</wil> <mw>sUkzmamakzika</mw>
PMS: right.
ejf1:  moved rule to wilson-map, slightly adjusted.

Corrected. remap?
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">Ca/Cu</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="G">SS: very similar but diff words. PMS: remapped to MW root; participle: prap of causative of prAR.</c> <wil err="scan" corr="prARayat">prARayata</wil> <mw>prAR</mw>

WARN SKIPPING: no records in wiltab for key=prANayata  (SLP = prARayata) (CORR=prARayat)  FOUND, so already corrected

PMS: Right. Grammar mapping of participle <wil>prARayat</wil> to MW root <mw>prAR</mw>
ejf1:  have already moved prARayat record to wilson-map, but removed the '  err="scan" corr="prARayat"' part.


Corrected. remap?

ejf1:  moved rule to wilson-ma, slightly adjusted.


Corrected. remap?
<rule conf="LIKELY" class="ERROR">s/m</rule> <c auth="PS" cclass="V">remapped. MW adds penultimate nasal found in present stem to root. MW[L=262731].  The Wilson root should not have final 'a'.</c> <wil err="fac" corr="his">hisa</wil> <mw>hiMs</mw>

ejf1:  moved rule to wilson-map, slightly adjusted.
